# Fraud detection in credit card payments and auto insurance claims using PySpark
Fraud detection classifier with the synthetic data for cridit card fraud called Paysim. In addition, two popular auto insurance fraud detection datasets are analyzed: the example of 1000 samples used in [Databricks' example notebook](https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/4954928053318020/1058911316420443/167703932442645/latest.html) and the [Oracle's example](https://blogs.oracle.com/datamining/fraud-and-anomaly-detection-made-simple) for outlier detection containing 15000 samples.  This example uses PySpark and it is prepared for large CSV file processing in standalone mode.

The Databricks dataset is mainly focused on the classification of the claims while the Oracle dataset is mainly focused on the classification of policy holders with fraudulent behavior. This makes a very interesting ensemble of features.
